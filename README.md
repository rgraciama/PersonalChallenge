My Personal Challenge

The purpose of this repository is to improve my Discipline and learn how to use CodeTree App.

I begining this trip selecting my targets and spliting the efforts to achieve it.

# 1st Step (How many time I usually have?)
- Saturday  - 4 hours.
- Sunday    - 6 hours.
- Monday    - 2 hours.
- Tuesday   - 3 hours.
- Wednesday - 2 hours.
- Thursday  - 3 hours.
- Friday    - 2 hours.
----------------------
- Total     - 22 hours. (I usually spend 22 hours per week).

Every week in the repository is called Milestone.

# 2th Step (How can I count the time scheduled to encapsule it in a Task/Issue?)
*To do it I decided to change the time in points like CodeTree App do.

I used the factor 1 point is like 12 minutes, and 5p. are 1 hour.
Every ticket is valued using the Fibonacci rule.

Using the time that I usually have every milestone the amount ascend to 110 points.

EASY PEACE!

# 3rd Step (What about my targets?)

I have 3 objectives.

- Improve my Programming skill. (50%)  -   55 points.
- Improve my English skill.     (30%)  -   33 points.
- Improve my Piano skill.       (20%)  -   22 points.

# 4th Step (How can I group the tickets?)

- Every Epic contains a group of Tasks to achieve a one countable result.
*Like a complete a course, revase some target points, complete assignement...

- Every Milestone can contains differ Epics. Almost one of every objective.

- Due Codetree App I cannot split the tasks in User Stories, cause I can not create subtasks of a task. But anyway IT'S PERFECT!

# 5th Step (What about my future targets parts and my next plans?)

- I create Epics, spliting tasks to fill backlog.
- I assign to every milestone some Epics to achieve the targets taking care do not exceed the number of points limited. 
(Re view Step 3).
- I do it every Saturday mornings with a cup of Coffee.
LIKE A BOSS!

# 6th Step (How can I follow my results?)

- At this moment I am filling some file (uploaded at this repo) with some important Keys values...

_In a future (not planified) I will do it some webpage or if codetree realises some charts to do a better tracking values then it will awesome. :D_

SEE YOU LATER ALLIGATOR!
